# When this flag is true, app operator runs in special mode in order to be able to run in partially deployed clusters.
# Main differences are:
# - runs on master nodes
# - runs on hostNetwork
# - tolerates all taints
# - uses API hostname to reach the API to support kube-proxy being missing
# This mode is meant to be used during bootstrap of management clusters to be able to deploy basic system services
# (such as the CNI or the out-of-tree cloud controller managers) as a managed app.
# After the cluster is fully deployed, this flag should be switched to false.
